# How Happy Are you?

A Linear Regression Analysis answering the question of: Does a model with more predictors fit the data
significantly better than a model with less predictors regarding an individual’s happiness?

The data set utilized was gathered from a survey of 100 volunteers to rate their happiness on a 10-point scale based on: gender, number of hours they work each week, and the quality of their love relationship. Each contributor’s happiness was calculated in the following point system: 1 = very unhappy, 10 = very happy; each contributor’s gender was categorized as: 
0 = male, 1 = female; and the quality of the volunteer’s love relationship was valued in a point-system as 1 = very lonely, 10 = deeply in love. 

We predict that a model with more predictors will fit the data better and play a significant role in one’s happiness.

### Conclusions
Overall, we can conclude that happiness is heavily dependent on gender, quality of relationship, and number of work hours, supporting our initial prediction. The only thing missing from our prediction that we did not account for is the significance of the two-way interaction between gender and relationship. A limitation to this data set/experiment is the the lack of other possible predictors that could help us determine a more precise conclusion related to an individual’s happiness level. Some questions that we would ask for future research would include the location where the individual resides, wealth status, age, and other similar variables that could affect the data set.
